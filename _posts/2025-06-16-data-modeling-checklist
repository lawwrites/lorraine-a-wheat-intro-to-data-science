# The Data-Modeling Checklist
Love and dating interests me. I want to know more about the struggles that men and women face today when pursuing love. Collecting data and organizing it poses a problem. Because first, I have to discover what am I looking for. I can't just go out into the world and collect data, I have to rely on what I am learning in my masters program at Westerns Govenors University's data science program. One of the first ideas established is the organizing data to reduce redundancy. WGU taught me to start with modeling the data and then building a database. In the midst of my studies, I discovered a data modeling checklist. The checklist comes from the eTextbook titled, "Database Systems: Design, Implementation, and Management." I admit I nerded out and read it from cover to cover.

## Business Rules
First identify the business rules. Business rules are the policies, procedures, principles that guide the organization. Good business rules are short and sweet and actionable. After identifying that business rule, I'll understand the nature and scope of my data so that I can build appropriate relationship rules and onstraints around the data. This leads to the proper identification of entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints. The verbs in a business rule translates into relationships among the entities. For example, men buy women dinner on a first date. From this business rule, I can conclude that
* Men, women, money, are entities, objects of interest.
* There is a "buy" relationship between men and money on the first date.

This business rule exists widely across America even though individuals may feel frustrated by the rule or do not practice it. Humans break rules, I know that, obviously. However, knowing the business rule, I can focus my research on data exploring the dollars spent by on the first date. Then I can start diving into whether the data promotes the business rules, goes against the business rules, or shows the inefficiencies of the business rule. 

### Document the business rules
Identify as many business rules and document them. 

## Entities
An **entity** is a nount that is meaningful to the business. No bruh or dude for man, or bad bitch for woman. Such common slang terms for a man or women are great to track. The entities are unique within the models, representing a single shubject. I find it great to track abrreviations, aliases, and synonyms because it may prove useful for coming up with common vocabulary. Thankfully, while I have many flaws, I am able to manage not using synonyms in the databases that I am working on alone. 

###Mini-checklist for entities
* Names are meaningful nouns
* They are unique within the model
* Composite entities include the abbreviated names of the entities linked through the composite. 
* * Composite entities model many-to-many relationships. Such as a student at a university enrolling into many courses and courses have manying studenties. The entities related to the compsite entity Enrollments() may originate from Students(student_id,name) and Courses(course_id, title, department). Enrollemnts(student_id, course_id, enrollment_date, grade) is then born to loving parents, a product of the many-to-many relationships.  
* They are not redundant
* Nonkey attributes fully depend on the Primary Key (PK)

## Attributes
* **Attribues** are the entities' descriptive characterics that use the entity abbreviation as a prefix. 

### Mini-checklist for attribues
* They are unique within the entity
* They are simple and atomic so that they cannot be further broken down. Name is not atomic because it can be simplified to first, middle, and last name.   
* Primary Key suffixes should include _ID, _NUM, _CODE.  
* No special characters


## Relationships
**Relationship** names are active and passive verbs that indicate the nature of the relationship. Strong relationships are normalized to reduce redundancies and eliminate data anomalies. Normalization follows three stages: first (1NF), second (2NF), and third (3NF) normal form. I do recognize that sometimes redundancy is necessary, so reaching 3NF is not always the goal. That depends on my business rules, and how much I want to join or search tables. At the very least, my goal in normalization is to eliminate multivalued attributes, define functional depndendies, and create a user-friendly design that is fast and operational. 

### Mini-checklist for relationships
* Clearly identify the partificants, the connectivity, and the cardinality. 
* Represents a set of distinguishable entity instances. 
* Conforms to 3NF standards unless a higher calling deems this unjustifiable. 
* PKs are clearly defined and support data granularity. 

##ER Model
**Entity-Relationship Models** are visually represent how the data is structurally organized in order to solve a business problem. The ER is a culmination of facts and dimensions. The facts can be measurments or aggregations like dollar spent, location. Dimensions provide the context such as year, date category (outdoor adventure, restaurant, artistic event). The ER model details the relationships between entities, serving as a map for the construction of the data. It has entities, attributes, relationship, primary keys, and foreign keys.
